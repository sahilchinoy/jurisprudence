# Hart's critique of Austin I

## Power-conferring rules

- John Austin: law = rules + sovereignty
	- A rule is a general command
		- A command is the expression of wish issued by someone willing and able to impose an "evil," called a sanction, if the wish is not obeyed
	- The sovereign is someone habitually obeyed by the bulk of population who habitually obeys nobody else
- Necessary properties:
	- A legal system exists when there is a sovereign who issues general commands
	- We know the system's contents: what was commanded and what costs might be imposed if you don't listen
		- Look at *behavioral regularities* between expressions of wishes, obedience, possibility of sanctions
	- Chicken came first: no need to find ultimate rules to convey authority on sovereign
		- Legal facts grounded in social facts (habitual obedience): a positivistic theory
	- Addresses Hume's puzzle: obligations, sovereignty, etc. are descriptive, not normative
- Hart critiques Austin's theory of rules
	- For Austin, all laws are "duty-imposing"
		- Lots of legal rules are: duty not to kill other people, reasonable care, etc.
	- But there are other rules that "confer power"
		- Constitutional law: set of laws that confer power
		- Civil procedure: confer power on private citizens to bring suit, property rights
		- We talk about these rules very differently
	- If you don't conform to a rule that imposes duty, you have "violated" it. You're "guilty"
		- But we don't say that about power-conferring rules
		- If you don't get two witnesses for a will, you're not "guilty" -- you just didn't do what the law tells you to do if you want to have certain kinds of legal effects
			- No punishments or sanctions, but your actions are null and void: they have no legal effect
	- Sometimes law is not trying to prevent you from doing something, it's trying to enable you to do something

## Nullities as sanctions

- Attempt to rehabilitate Austin
	- No sanctions associated with power-conferring rules?
	- Austin's response: actually, power-conferring rules *are* general commands backed by threat of sanction: nullity
	- If you don't follow the rules, you are "sanctioned" in the sense that what you wanted to do won't be done
- Hart: but there is a difference between duty-imposing and power-conferring rules in their relationship to sanctions
	- Duty-imposing: sanction is logically detachable from rule itself
		- Can imagine a rule without a sanction
	- Power-conferring: can't do this
		- Can't have success without the possibility of failure
	- Sanction associated with duty-imposing rule is designed to make you *worse off* than you would have been without sanction
		- Compare to nullity, which is not the imposition of cost, but refusal to confer a benefit

## Kelsen's theory

- Hans Kelsen: agreed with Austin that law is composed of rules always backed by sanctions
	- Power-conferring rules are not real rules; they are fragments of duty-imposing rules which themselves impose sanctions
- Austin expanded category of sanctions to include nullities
	- Kelsen says no, sanctions are what Hart thinks they are, but power-conferring rules are not rules in their own right
- All rules have sanctions built-in
	- All rules are directed at legal officials, not ordinary citizens
	- Direct them to impose sanctions under certain circumstances
	- Ex: a testator has authority to distribute estate according to wishes if and only if they sign the will and two witnesses attest
		- Kelsen: that's only part of the rule. The rule is a long conditional where the antecedent is what the testator has to do, and the consequent is what duties the court is under regarding the executor carrying out the will
		- Rule which seems to confer power on testator is really the conditions under which court is under duty to impose sanction on executor if they don't execute the will
- Hart's response to Kelsen: this distorts the function of the law
	- Function of the law is to guide our conduct: guides testator conduct, guides executor's conduct, guides probate court's conductâ€¦ 
	- Then it's silly to think all rules are directed at officials to impose sanctions on executors
	- It's backwards to say that the wills law is directed at officials. It's directed at the people who want to write wills, the people who have to execute them, etc.
