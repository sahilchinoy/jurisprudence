# Hart on law and morality

## Justice in law

- Law is necessarily indeterminate. Social acts of guidance run out because
	1. For guidance via example/authoritative precedent, we don't know how close your case is to the precedent
	2. For guidance via general rules, natural language has open texture
	- Judges look to morality when law runs out
	- But when they figure out what the law is, they look to the core; not the same as looking to morality
- For Hart, legal positivism means law and morality are not necessarily connected
	- Our definition of positivism is different: legal facts rest on social facts alone, not moral facts
	- Law and morality are obviously connected in certain ways
- Law and justice have an important connection, seem to go together
	- Not everything that is morally bad is unjust, like tripping somebody
	- Justice is maintaining or restoring balance of benefits and burdens
		- Lots of different types: distributive, retributive, etc.
		- Formal justice: treating like cases alike
		- Law seems to involve an element of formal justice
			- When you follow the law, you necessarily treat like cases alike
			- Hart calls this "justice in application"
	- But there is a difference between justice in application and justice in the rules themselves
		- E.g. Jim Crow laws
- Law and morality are similar, but have important differences
	- Similarities:
		- Legal and moral rules often coincide: ther are rules against assaulting people, engaging in fraud, destroying others' property...
			- Morality tends to be more general (doesn't specify how fast you should drive)
		- Binding without consent: you don't agree to moral rules or to the law
		- Constitute floors of acceptable behavior
		- Supported by social pressure for conformity
	- Differences:
		- Moral rules are almost always important; legal rules can be trivial
		- Morality immune to deliberate change: can't repeal morality
		- Morality has an element of voluntariness: you can always say "I couldn't help it"
		- Moral rules are backed socially; law is backed by financial and physical sanctions (in addition to social pressure)

## Minimum content of the natural law

- Natural law typically seen as the opposite of legal positivism: argues there is a necessary connection between law and morality
	- Again, our definition is different: legal facts rest on moral facts
	- "Natural law" sometimes taken to mean that morality is objective and discoverable by human reasoning
- Hart: doctrine of the minimum content of the natural law
	- Hart: law and morality are nomologically connected -- it's *necessary* that human beings will have to have moral rules as part of their laws
	- Law is geared towards social survival, hence there are rules to protect life, limb, and property
	- 5 features that necessitate these kinds of rules: We areâ€¦
		1. Physically vulnerable to one another
		2. Roughly equal
		3. Altruistic to a limited degree
		4. Living in a world of scarcity
		5. Rational to limited degree
	- Need rules to live together
		- Survival of group protected by rules, but that doesn't mean rules are just to everyone
	- Nomological necessity doesn't imply a morally just legal system

## Normative legal positivism

- Every legal system requires not just coercive power, but acceptance of authority
	- 2 claims: some have to take internal POV, and some have to accept legitimacy of authority
	- First claim doesn't imply law and morality are connected
		- Some people have to take internal POV, but they can be small subset
		- Can take internal POV for reasons that don't deal with morality
	- Second claim: Weber argued that any legal system must be based not just on coercion but on acceptance of authority by majority of population
		- This is again nomological but not metaphysical
- Law contains many moral terms, but this doesn't mean law and morality are necessarily connected
- When judges exercise moral discretion:
	- They can make mistakes, which leads law and morality to come apart
	- They go beyond the law -- morality plays a role precisely because law has run out
- Seems as if our standards for evaluating legal systems use moral considerations 
	- A "good" legal system is a *morally* good legal system
	- True that we evaluate law based on moral considerations, but law may fail to actually be good and it's still a legal system
- Law implies justice in application
	- But again, formal justice doesn't imply rules themselves are just
- Hart: If a law is unjust, you shouldn't obey it, so it seems as if law and morality are necessarily connected
	- True, but the law you're not supposed to obey is still the law
	- Shouldn't confuse the idea that one is *legally* obligated to follow the law, with the idea that one is *morally* obligated to follow the law
	- Natural lawyer says if law is not just, it's not law; positivist says it's still law, it's just law you shouldn't obey
		- How do you critique unjust law if, under the natural law view, it's not law?
- "Normative legal positivism": the reason we should be legal positivists is that, morally speaking, we act better if we treat unjust laws as laws instead of denying that they're laws
	- Argument on moral grounds for being legal positivist
	- But this is a bad way to argue for positivism
		- How do we know the best way to get people to act morally and disobey unjust rules?
