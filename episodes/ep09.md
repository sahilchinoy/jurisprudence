# Hart on interpretation

## Formalism and open texture

- Hart is trying to find middle ground between formalism and legal realism
- What is formalism? Committed to 4 theses:
	1. Judges must always apply the law and can't override it
	2. Determinacy: for any question, law has an answer. There is always law to apply
		- Thus, law can't just be a list of rules, or it would have to be infinite
	3. Conceptualism: In order to derive the law, one has to know a set of general principles from which it is possible to interpret concepts to derive the answer in a particular case
		- There are not an infinite number of rules, just a handful of general principles in any area of law
	4. Amorality of adjudication: judges are not supposed to engage in moral reasoning
- People think legal positivism (law rest on social facts alone, not moral facts) implies formalism
	- If law doesn't depend on moral facts, there are no moral facts to use when judges are deciding cases, so positivists are necessarily formalists; therefore positivism is wrong
- Hart says positivism is not committed to formalism
- Why is formalism dumb? Judicial opinions are filled with moral arguments about "what justice requires" or "virtuous behavior" or "obscenity"
- Hart wants to argue positivism implies *anti*-formalism
	- If you think there's always law to apply and judges are always supposed to apply it and never use moral reasoning, then it follows that law doesn't depend on moral facts
	- But that's because you've assumed formalism is true (formalism â†’ positivism)
- There are 2 ways to guide conduct, both incomplete:
	1. Precedent or authoritative example
		- Pointing to some person/action and saying "do that"
	2. General rule
		- Say "men are supposed to take their hats off in church"
	- In either case, there are gaps in guidance
		- Precedent: how similar to precedent does it have to be? Narrowly, broadly?
		- General rule: what do you mean by "hat," "church," etc.?
	- Hart: General terms in natural language have "open texture" or vagueness
		- No way in natural language to get rid of this vagueness
		- General terms have a "core" of settled examples and a "penumbra," an area of vagueness
		- Can't get around this by introducing more rules, since more natural language would have its own open texture
		- What if you say "when it's vague, decide in favor of defendant"?
			- But "vagueness" and "open texture" are themselves vague and open-textured, leading to higher-order vagueness
- "Limits of the social" argument: insofar as positivism believes that law is a set of standards that are picked out socially, law is going to be necessarily indeterminate because it can't cover every conceivable case
	- Because either you pick out law through authoritative example or you're using general terms in natural language
- Positivism implies anti-formalism: judges are going to have to rely on moral judgement to decide cases because they're going to run out of law to apply
- Judges may act like they're finding the law, but when they apply morality to decide cases, they're making new law
- Legal realism: reaction to formalism. Judges take principles and use them to make decisions based on policy considerations
- Can't get from principles to a specific case without using normative reasoning, and it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise
	- When judges look at past cases, there just aren't enough cases to say "this is what we should do"

## Rule skepticism

- Hart says you can't be a skeptic about primary rules
	- You can't say courts never follow the law, because there wouldn't be courts without the law that establishes the courts
- Mistake to point to open texture as proof that law is indeterminate
	- Yes, law has area of open texture, but also has area of settled meaning, a core
	- So you also can't be a thoroughgoing skeptic about secondary rules
- Can be skeptic about complicated cases: Supreme Court decisions, cases in the penumbra -- no law to apply in these cases
- Hart: people confuse finality with infallibility
	- Decision can be final but wrong
	- E.g. impeachment: what is a high crime or misdemeanor? Whatever the Senate says it is? No. It is true that nobody can challenge the Senate's decision about conviction. The decision is final, but it could be wrong
- Dworkin challenges the idea that when judges are looking to moral principles, they are making law
	- He thinks they're still *finding* law, it's just that law depends on moral facts as well as social facts
- When it comes to resolving questions regarding the rule of recognition, judges make a decision, and if others accept it, it is the law going forward, because a new extension of social practice will have been formed
	- When it's accepted, it becomes part of the rule of recognition
	- The fact of acceptance makes it correctly decided (retrospectively)

## Fuller's critique

- Judges are supposed to think about the purpose of the law
- Because we think judges should approach legal interpretation by considering statute's purpose, it's a mistake to think law and morality are separate
	- The judge, in looking to purpose, is trying to figure out what you *ought* to do
- Hart's positivism can't explain intuition that looking to purpose is important
	- This is wrong. It is possible to talk about purpose of statute without thinking about morality, e.g. what were legislators trying to achieve in enacting a regulation? These are social facts
