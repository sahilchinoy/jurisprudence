# The Hart-Dworkin debate

## Principles in hard cases

- Dworkin says Hart didn't answer "what is law"
	- Critiques Hart's positivist view, which Dworkin says has 3 theses
		1. Every legal system has master test which distinguishes legal norms by pedigree (the way they were created rather than what they are)
			- Pedigree is the institutional source
			- C.f. content, which asks, is it a good rule?
		2. When rules run out, judges exercise discretion
		3. There are no legal obligations in the absence of legal rules
	- Dworkin takes positivism to be a model of rules and argues law contains more than just rules
- 1st thesis: Alludes to Hart's rule of recognition
	- Dworkin doesn't specify it must be a social rule, like Hart does
	- Hart doesn't say anything about pedigree of rules, which Dworkin imputes

## Rules vs. principles

- 2nd thesis: seems trivially true
- Dworkin uses specific characterization of a "rule": a norm that has an all-or-nothing character, c.f. a principle with "dimension of weight"
- Speed limit is a rule, applies in all-or-nothing manner
- Principles can conflict, unlike rules
- Dworkin says positivists think law is just rules, not principles
- Weak discretion: exercise judgement in order to carry out an order
	- "Do this at your discretion" means your decision is not subject to review, but you're under an obligation to do *something*
- Strong discretion: under no duty/obligation at all
- Positivists say when rules run out, judges exercise strong discretion
	- No more rules, thus judges not under any duty to apply rules, thus they choose whatever standards they want
	- Dworkin thinks this is a bad description of legal practice. Judges don't follow 2-step procedure: (1) check if rules apply (2) if not, make new law
		- They always act *as if* there is law to apply
		- Because law consists of principles as well as rules
- In hard cases, rules run out but legal principles do not. Judges must weigh them against each other to figure out what to do
	- Exercising weak discretion
- Does Dworkin mischaracterize Hart?
	- Hart would have accepted that in addition to all-or-nothing standards, there are legal principles
	- Dworkin trying to explain why Hart insisted judges exercise strong discretion
	- Hart thought the law often runs out, so judges often exercise discretion and act like legislators
- If you're a positivist, you have to insist the law runs out since it depends on social facts alone
	- There is a limit to guiding people's conduct through social guidance
- Legal principles are legal because of their content, not because of their pedigree
	- Dworkin says this conflicts with first thesis
- In hard cases, judges look to principles
	- Thus the law doesn't consist of just rules (no strong discretion)
	- Thus the rule of recognition can't identify principles as legal principles because legality derives from content, not pedigree

## Exclusive vs. inclusive legal positivism

- What can positivists say in response? Dworkin assumes all norms that courts under duty to apply are law
	- But can be under duty to apply norm that is not a *legal* norm
	- When court looks outside the law to morality, judge is not converting moral principles into the law
	- When pedigreed rules run out, judges are under obligation to look to morality, but this doesn't make morality law
	- Exclusive legal positivism: moral rules can never be legal rules
- Another response is to deny Dworkin's characterization: inclusive legal positivism
	- Rule of recognition says that when pedigreed standards run out, non-pedigreed standards win
	- Accepts the idea that rule of recognition can incorporate non-pedigreed norms
- ELP: just because you're under obligation to apply moral principles, that doesn't convert moral principles to legal principles
- ILP: rule of recognition can carry non-pedigreed standards. Law can be picked out by moral facts as long as social facts tell you to pick them out
