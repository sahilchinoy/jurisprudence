# Law's Empire strikes back

## Recap

- View that positivism implies formalism
	- Formalists believe that judges never use moral reasoning
	- Seemed that positivists are committed to this idea since they think law rests on social facts alone
		- So positivists would say judge should never rely on moral reasoning
	- Hart says positivism actually implies *anti*-formalism
		- Social facts can't pick out comprehensive standards of guidance ("limits of the social")
		- Picking exemplars or using general terms always has areas of indeterminacy
		- So judges inevitably have to rely on moral reasoning
- Dworkin says judges *never* act as though the law is indeterminate
	- Always act as though there is law to find by looking to principles that are valid because they are morally appropriate
	- Not as though the law is indeterminate and judges make new law
	- So formalism is true and therefore positivism must be false
- Inclusive legal positivism: judges do look to morality, but social facts say that moral facts are relevant
	- Rule of recognition says that when socially designated standards run out, they should look to morality
- Exclusive legal positivism: the fact that judges look outside the law does not make these extra-legal standards the law

## Dworkin's critique of legal positivism

- Dworkin shows why the legal positivist response won't work using a new critique: "the problem of theoretical disagreements"
	- Most powerful objection to positivism
- Dworkin distinguishes *propositions of law:* statement of a legal fact in a particular jurisdiction, which can be true or false by virtue of the *grounds of law*: the facts that render a proposition of law true
	- Ex: Propositions of law in California are true if a bill that expresses the proposition is approved by a majority of the legislature, signed by governor, etc.
	- In Hart's terminology, grounds of law are part of the criteria of legal validity
- Dworkin says people can disagree about the grounds of law in 2 ways:
	1. Empirical disagreement about whether grounds of law are satisfied in a given case
	2. Theoretical disagreement about what the grounds of law *are* in a particular legal system
- Dworkin says according to positivism, all disagreements about propositions of law are really empirical, never theoretical
	- But it is common for legal actors to have theoretical disagreements and positivism can't explain this
- Dworkin says positivists accept "plain-fact" view of the law:
	- Grounds of law are the facts that people agree render propositions in that jurisdiction true
	- Grounds of law must refer to matters of historical fact/pedigree
		- This is saying all positivists are exclusive legal positivists
		- But most people are inclusive legal positivists
- Dworkin says there are disagreements about grounds of law: which facts you look to in order to determine whether a proposition is true or false
	- Positivists can't explain this because for them because for them grounds of law are determined by consensus
	- If there's disagreement, then something cannot be a ground of law
	- For positivists, disagreement about grounds of law leads to incoherence

## Constructive interpretation

- No way out of this by being an exclusive or inclusive legal positivist: for both, the grounds of law are determined by consensus
	- Difference between them is on what kinds of things there can be consensus on
		- Inclusive legal positivist says consensus on moral facts is still law
- Counterargument: positivism is correct but legal actors are incoherent
	- But this is not a small disagreement, this is a fundamental feature of law: it is determined by consensus among legal actors
- Another counterargument: legal actors argue for things they don't believe in, even if they involve conceptual mistakes
	- But it's not the fact of the theoretical disagreement itself that is insincere, it's that they're arguing for a specific position
- Analogy to literary criticism: theoretical disagreements about what Shakespeare meant, not empirical disagreements about what he said
	- At bottom, having a disagreement about what makes literature valuable and what kind of methodology would make it the most valuable it could be
	- Constructive interpretation: "imposing purpose on an object or practice in order to make it the best possible example of the form or genre to which it is taken to belong"
	- Ask "what makes literature great?" and then pick a methodology that reflects that
	- In law: imposing moral theory about what makes law valuable, grounds of law are the ones that make law morally the best that it can be
		- How do you make legal practice the best it can be? The interpretation that best *fits* and *justifies* legal practice
- Fit: extent to which it approves of the object's existence or its properties
	- One purpose fits better than another when it recommends behavior that more closely matches observed conduct
	- Ex: 2 interpretations of Christmas: rank commercialism vs. goodwill and peace on earth
		- Former fits better because practice of Christmas is more in line with rank commercialism than peace on earth
- Justification: which of the purposes is more morally justified
	- Goodwill and peace on earth is more justified than rank commercialism
- How to balance the two? Maybe justification is more important: Christmas is better when we see it as goodwill and peace on earth
