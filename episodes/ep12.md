# Law as integrity

## Concept vs. conception

- Positivists say law ultimately depends on social facts
- Dworkin says no, morality is at the foundation of law -- judges look to morality in hard cases
	- Positivists say rule of recognition has moral principles as criteria for validity
	- Exclusive positivists: judges using moral principles doesn't make them into legal principles
- Both exclusive and inclusive legal positivists accept the idea that criteria for legal validity (grounds of law) are determined by consensus
	- Dworkin: that assumes there *is* consensus, but there are theoretical disagreements about what the grounds of law are
	- Positivists can't explain the possibility of disagreements
- Constructive interpretation: imposing purpose on social practice so it can be the best possible example of the thing it is
	- Of the law: make legal practice the best it can be, morally
	- Need fit and justification
- Which grounds of law fit and justify legal practice?
- For Dworkin, 2 stages to legal interpretation:
	1. What are the grounds of law?
	2. In a given case, do the grounds of law apply?
		- In order to figure out which propositions are true and decide the case
- Dworkin approaches the first stage in two substages: figure out concept of law, then the right conception of law
	- Concept: what would make the law the best it can be at very abstract level
	- Conception: more precise characterization
		- 3 different conceptions, ask which one makes the law the best it can be
- Concept of law: law is about ensuring that the state does not use coercion unless it is compatible with the rights and responsibilities that flow from past political acts
	- Dworkin thinks everyone will sign onto this, but maybe this doesn't hold up
	- Law doesn't just *limit* the state, but *guides* the state

## Conventionalism

- 3 conceptions that purport to make law the best it can be
	1. Conventionalism
	2. Pragmatism
	3. Law as integrity
- Conception: interpretation of a particular legal practice (e.g. American law), purports to identify 2 things:
	- The moral purpose of the practice
	- The sets of facts such a purpose commends as the grounds of law
- A conception of law should fit and justify the practice
	- Fits: facts it identifies are actually the grounds of law recognized by officials
	- Justifies: purpose it assigns to law is morally justifiable
- Conventionalism: rights and responsibilities flow from past political acts when they are specifically decided by those acts
	- To identify rights and responsibilities, look to the conventions of the system
	- Purpose: to give people fair warning and protect their expectations about how the state is going to act
	- Grounds: those given by convention
	- If you respect convention, then you will be protecting people's expectations and giving them fair warning because everyone knows what the conventions are
	- Sounds like exclusive legal positivism, but it isn't
		- Positivism: convention determines what the law is, but not because this makes the law the best it can be
		- Conventionalism is the "Dworkinian spin" on positivism
	- When conventions run out, act in the way you think is best
		- Gives judges flexibility
	- Does it fit?
		- No. Even when conventions run out, people still disagree about what the grounds of law are, and judges still feel constrained by the law
	- Is it justified?
		- No. Balance between fair warning and flexibility doesn't track cases where there's convention or no convention
			- Sometimes good to have flexibility even when conventions are clear
			- Sometimes good to protect expectations even when there are no conventions
- Pragmatism: Richard Posner's theory of interpretation -- rejects the idea that the past constrains the present
	- Judge should make the decision that maximizes community welfare
	- Skeptical conception of law: what legal officials did in the past doesn't matter
	- This doesn't fit the way judges think of past political acts, nor does it seem justified
- Law as integrity: rights and responsibilities flow from past political acts when they are conferred and imposed by principles and policies that portray these political acts in their best light
	- If we want to know what makes the law the best it can be, law as integrity says: grounds of law should be determined by the principles and policies that make the law the best it can be
	- The purpose that is furthered by those grounds of law is the ideal of integrity
		- Integrity: acting according to the set of principles and policies that are consistent across all members of the community in all cases
		- "Requires governments to speak with one voice, act in principled and coherent manner towards all its citizens"
	- If we treat some members of a community some way, even if we treated them that way mistakenly, ideal of integrity requires that we treat other members that way too

## Hercules

- Rawls's theory of justice: justice as fairness
- Dworkin: like the best interpretation of justice is fairness, the best intepretation of law is integrity
- Grounds of law are those that present past political acts in their best light
- Does it fit?
	- Dworkin says yes, because it can explain something that other conceptions of law can't: our abhorrence of "checkerboard statutes"
		- Checkerboard statute makes arbitrary distinctions on matters of important principles
	- This is an unfair comparison. Conventionalism fits some aspects of legal practice just like law as integrity fits some aspects of legal practice
	- You could say law as integrity doesn't fit because of federalism, which is a kind of checkerboard solution
- Is it justified?
	- Wny is state justified in imposing coercion? Not because we consented, not because it's fair, but because we're part of "fraternal community" where we live according to same set of principles
	- Generates associative obligations to obey the law
	- To investigate this, you need to do serious political philosophy
- If you accept law as integrity, how do you intepret the law? This is the second stage
	- Dworkin says look at principles that will put past political acts in their best light
		- Need to take into account *all* past political acts -- need to be superhuman
		- Dworkin calls his judge "Hercules"
		- Thinks of the judge as a moral-political philosopher; legal issues always pose philosophical issues
