# Chicken or egg?

## The possibility puzzle

- Chicken-egg puzzle: rules have come from some entity, but for that entity to have legal authority, there needs to be a rule giving them legal authority, but where did that come from?
	- Ex: Congress enacts stimulus plan
	- Why is that legally valid? Article I of the Constitution
	- Why is Article I legally valid? The Constitution has been ratified, and Article 7 says if Â¾ of original states ratify the Constitution then it's valid
	- But Article 7 is part of the Constitution. Seems circular. How can a provision that's part of a document confer legal authority on the document it's part of?
- Conflict between 2 principles:
	1. "Egg principle": some body has power to create legal norms only if existing norm confers that authority
	2. "Chicken principle": a legal rule exists only if someone with power to do so created it
	- End up in a vicious cycle or an infinite regress
- 2 ways of solving:
	1. Deny the egg principle: certain bodies have authority even if there was no rule which conferred that authority
		- Austin does this: law is possible because there is an ultimate authority (the sovereign) who gets authority from pure political power
		- Positivistic solution -- grounding legal facts in social facts
		- But anyone who tries to solve the puzzle via social facts like this runs into Hume's puzzle
	2. Deny chicken principle: legal rules can exist which confer authority even if nobody created those rules

## Hume's puzzle

- Hume's law: can't derive an ought from an is
	- Normative conclusion has to be derived from a normative premise
- Positivism: legal facts don't depend on moral facts
	- Any kind of argument that establishes existence of legal facts will run into argument that's missing normative premise
- Austin: sovereign is someone who has brute political power
	- This is a positive statement, but the law seem to have normative claims
- Natural lawyers don't have this problem because they think are legal facts also grounded in moral facts, which are normative
- If you don't believe in moral facts, do you have to be a legal positivist? Yes
	- If you don't believe in morality as objective, then the only way you can be a natural law theorist is if you deny that legal facts exist
	- If you accept legal facts, then you can't be a natural law theorist
	- Historically, positivists drawn to the theory because they are skeptical about existence of moral facts
- What if you think moral facts are constituted by social facts, i.e. morality is a social construction? Does that mean you're a positivist? No
	- Social facts themselves are not metaphysically basic
	- In jurisprudence, don't want to worry about methodological issues of what social/moral facts themselves depend on

## John Austin's theory of law

- Law has two parts: theory of rules and theory of sovereignty. Law = rules + sovereignty
- All rules are commands: expression of a wish, backed by a threat to inflict an evil if the wish is not fulfilled, issued by someone who is willing and able to act on the threat
	- Austin thought obligations were analytically related to commands in that people are under obligation when another expresses a wish, backed by threat, that they act or don't act a certain way
	- Anytime someone commands someone to do something, they're obligated to do it
	- All rules are "general" commands
- Who is the sovereign?
	- Obeyed by most people most of the time
	- Must not habitually obey anybody else
- Law is general commands backed by threats issued by someone who is habitually obeyed and who habitually obeys nobody else
	- Can derive necessary properties: given what obligations are, all laws impose obligations
- Gives simple solution to the chicken-egg problem -- legal facts "bottom out" in sovereign
	- Whether you habitually obey someone is not a normative statement, it's a statement of social fact
- Also solves Hume's puzzle: obligations are not normative, they are descriptive 
	- Any legal argument that has obligations as (descriptive) conclusions need not have normative premises
- Ultimate idea: law rests on power, habits of obedience, expresses of wishes backed by threats of sanctions
	- This theory dominant for a century (until Hart's "Concept of Law")
	- But Austin is wrong!
