# Planning theory of law I

## Planning

- Conclude neither positivist theory (Austin, Hart) are successful
- Dworkin's alternative: legal facts ultimately depend on moral facts as well
	- Possibility of theoretical disagreements
- Alternative positivistic theory that tries to integrate law with other phenomena in non-legal sphere -- activity of planning
	- One area where everyone is a positivist: plans
	- If we plan to take the train to the beach, morality has nothing to do with it
	- We can think of legal activity as social planning
- Starting point: "legal activity" is what legal officials, legislatures, courts, administrative agencies do
	- Creation, application, enforcement of legal norms
	- Legal activity is activity of social planning
		- Deciding actions we may or may not do and which people have the authority to decide what we may or may not do
- What is planning? Michael Bratman says what makes human beings unique is not just that we're rational (means-ends calculations) but that we have the ability to plan
	- Incremental: we fill in our plans over time
	- Past decisions form a framework that guides new decisions
	- Hart: we don't want all legal rules to answer every question, want to leave open texture for judges to decide
	- This is the way planning works: leave degree of flexibility to fill plan in as future becomes the present
	- Legislation also has this "fill in as you go along" structure -- it becomes more specific, determinate over time

## Law as a planning organization

- Legal activity is not just the activity of social planning, but also a *shared* activity
	- Something that legal officials do together
	- Legal officials are following shared plan, which tells them what each of their roles are
	- Hart's rule of recognition is part of this shared plan, part of the way legal officials coordinate
- Legal activity is *official* -- those who engage in social planning inhabit offices, stable/permanent positions of authority where turnover of occupants is possible and expected
- Legal activity is *institutional* -- legal relations obtain independent of intentions of people involved
	- If shared plan validates a proposed plan (e.g. a majority of legislators vote yes), then the law is legally valid regardless of why the legislators voted that way
	- Laws are not commands because you can enact laws without knowing what they are
		- Social plans can be created as long as people follow the shared plan -- they may not intend to create the plan they are creating
- Legal activity forms an *organization*
	- Parents are not legal systems: they are shared planners, but they don't form an organization
	- Their planning is not institutional (you have to *know* what you're planning for your kids)
- Legal activity is a *compulsory* planning organization -- you can't say you didn't consent to a particular law

## The moral aim thesis

- What kind of compulsory planning organization is the law?
- If you think of law as an organization, participants engaged in collective activity because they accept a shared plan, then it's easy to see why legal positivism makes sense: organizations are created through intentions/actions of groups (social facts)
	- Morality seems to play no role
	- Positivism becomes an obvious position to take
- But purpose of legal organization is moral in nature
	- Fundamental aim of law is to rectify moral deficiency associated with circumstances of legality
	- Meet moral demand of the circumstances of legality in efficient manner
		- Enable communities to solve numerous, serious problems that would otherwise be too costly/risky to resolve
	- Doesn't give up on positivism: law has a moral aim, but it doesn't have to satisfy that moral aim in order to be law
		- Constitutive aim of an assertion is to tell the truth, but it's still an assertion if the person is lying
		- Legal systems that don't solve moral problems they're supposed to solve are still legal systems, they're just bad/unjust
	- Motivations/justifications
		1. Modern life needs law because we have complicated moral problems
		2. Legal systems unable to solve serious moral problems are criticizable
		3. Consider criminal organizations. They are institutional, compulsory, but they are not legal systems because we don't think of them as aiming to solve a moral problem -- they are part of the moral problem of the circumstances of legality
			- When organized crime does something good, we think of it as serendipitous, but not so with the law
			- We think the law is *supposed* to solve moral problems, unlike criminal organizations
- So far, what is law: compulsory planning organization with a moral aim
	- But not all compulsory planning organization with a moral aim are legal systems
	- Consider a condo board: creates rules for residents, applies them in cases of dispute. Constituted by officials whose intentions are irrelevant, rules binding irrespective of consent. Aim to solve problems that can't be solved through other forms of social ordering. But not a legal system. Why not?
	- Maybe: legal systems always claim *supreme authority*, and Florida law trumps the condo rules
		- This argument doesn't work because then Florida wouldn't have a legal system either, since federal law supersedes Florida law
- Although state law must comply with federal law, federal law automatically presumes state law complies with federal law
	- Federal law gives states the benefit of the doubt, allows them to make and enforce law without first checking
	- By contrast, states afford nothing comparable to private actors
	- Not enough for rules made by private actors to be in compliance with state law. They are not allowed to enforce laws unless private actor demonstrates compliance with state laws
	- State police can yank skinny dipper from pool. Condo board can't do that -- they need to call police, prosecutor needs to be involved
		- Condo board doesn't enjoy same presumption of validity/compliance as state government
- Legal systems are self-certifying systems
	- Planning organization is self-certifying when it enjoys *presumption of validity* from superior planning organization
	- Thus, condo board is not a legal system, but Florida law is
