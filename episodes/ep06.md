# The rule of recognition

## Introduction

- Austin's theory: ignores existence of power-conferring rules, can't explain true nature of duty-imposing rules, can't explain continuity of legal authority, etc.
- Can't explain intelligibility of law: we speak about law as institution that confers rights and imposes duties
	- Can't render normative nature of law intelligible because the theory is based on the non-normative, purely descriptive concept of power
	- Power does not give you enough conceptual apparatus to explain rights, duties
	- Category mistake: just because sovereign can force you to do something doesn't mean you *ought* to do it
	- Need to have law that gives us reasons to act: internal point of view
- Hart says we take law as a guide to conduct and a way to evaluate others' conduct
	- Social rule is not just behavioral regularity, it's accepted from internal POV
- At foundation of law: social rules/practices taken as guides of conduct, reasons for action
- Imagine pre-legal society. All rules are customary: share food in a certain way, choose mates in a certain way, all accepted from internal POV
	- Problem of uncertainty: one part of group says act this way, other says different, no way to resolve this other than by counting heads
	- Problem of stasis: no way to change the rules quickly, have to wait until people's behavior changes and accept it from internal POV
		- You want to be able to change behavior by changing rules. But if the rules are how people act, then the only way you can change rules is by changing behavior
	- Problem of inefficiency: no mechanism, institution to resolve disputes
- Law is a solution to these three problems
	- Uncertainty: rule of recognition is the rule that tells you which rules are binding
	- Stasis: rule of change is the power-conferring rule that says who has ability to change the rules
	- Inefficiency: rule of adjudication is the social rule that designates institution/person to decide whether rules have been obeyed

## Properties of the rule of recognition

- Rule of recognition: identifies properties of rules that make it authoritative within group
	- In US: if Congress enacts legislation and signed by President (or overridden), then it's law, and judges have duty to apply/adjudicate it
	- Secondary rule: a rule about other rules
	- Social rule: practiced by group, accepted by internal POV
	- Practiced only by officials. The rule of recognition is addressed to officials, like judges
		- Citizens do not accept the rule of recognition
	- Ultimate rule: its existence does not depend on any other rule
	- Supreme rule: if anything conflicts, rule of recognition wins
	- Tells you order of precedence of laws (ex: federal vs. state)
	- Duty-imposing rule: imposes duty on officials to apply certain rules to cases that arise before them
- Rule of change, adjudication are power-conferring
- Constitution is not rule of recognition -- it's a collection of rules of change and adjudication
- Resolve Austin's puzzles:
	- Continuity: Austin cannot explain continuity of legal authority because thinks all sovereignty is derived from habits
		- Hart: rule of recognition says whatever Rex II says becomes law when Rex I dies
		- Continuous practice of rule recognition in the background
	- Persistence: Austin can't explain how rules made 100 years ago still bind, since the threat is no longer valid
		- Hart: rule of recognition says that if rule bears certain properties, then it is still a rule
	- Rule of recognition is a supreme rule, don't need idea of habitual obedience to a sovereign
	- What makes a law a law? Validated by group's rule of recognition
	- Can explain how rules apply to their makers
		- Legal rules are standards validated by rule of recognition, and you can make a standard that applies to yourself
	- Doesn't imply sovereign is above the law, because for Hart, sovereign is *created* by the law

## The rule of recognition rules

- Rule of recognition, change, adjudication are not validated by anything else. They are ultimate rules that exist by virtue of being practiced
- Hart: two conditions for existence of legal system
	- Need secondary rules: rule of recognition, change, adjudication
	- Officials have to accept these from internal POV
		- Non-officials don't have to accept these (not addressed to them)
		- They have to follow the law most of the time, but not from internal POV
			- Can obey because afraid of being punished, or habit, doesn't matter
	- Bifurcation: officials have to accept from internal POV, subjects have to obey law for any reason whatsoever
- Hart: essence of law is the union of primary and secondary rules
	- Primary rules are those validated by rule of recognition
