# Planning theory of law II

## Solving the puzzles

- Possibility puzzle: legal authority needs norm that confers power, but need someone with legal authority to confer that power
	- Planning theory follows "egg" principle: all authority comes from norms of instrumental rationality
	- We are planning creatures, able to coordinate across time and people, and through this form of partial-staged deliberation we solve problems we couldn't otherwise solve
	- The foundation of legal system is a shared plan -- most officials accept their part in the plan
	- Ability to adopt and share a plan is unmysterious
	- Planning theory rests legal authority on power of planning agents to adopt norms to coordinate activities over time and across persons (instrumental rationality)
- Austin: all laws backed by sanctions, ultimately rest on power
	- Plans can be duty-imposing or power-conferring
	- No problem with continuity/persistence (sovereign dies, power passed on because shared plan says new person is sovereign)
- Hart: assimilated social rules of recognition, change, and adjudication to behavior of legal officials
	- We said norms/behaviors are different things, practices are not rules
	- Plans are something separate from behavior conforming to the plans
	- Not all social practices generate social rules -- e.g. shouldn't drop the toaster in the bath
		- Hart failed to specify what kinds of practices generate rules
	- Plan has to be created with group in mind, accepted by most of officials. Thus not all social practices generate shared plans, only the ones that involve plan adoption and sharing
	- Unlike Hart, planning theory melds all secondary rules into "master plan" for the system
- Hume's challenge: how is it that merely by adopting a plan, legal authority and obligations can be generated?
	- How do we get obligations, rights from social facts alone?
	- Plan could be highly unjust
	- Doesn't generate *moral* obligations, but generates normativity that comes from instrumental rationality (rational obligations)
	- How do you get legal obligations out of mere instrumental rationality? You don't
	- 2 roles that the word "legal" plays:
		1. Adjectival interpretation: "authority" and "obligation" are moral concepts,so "legal authority" is a moral authority of a certain sort, but a legal moral authority -- arises by virtue of being part of legal system
			- Can't get moral obligations from mere social facts
		2. Perspectival interpreation: way of distancing from claims of moral obligation/authority
			- From the perspective of the law, have moral authority/morally obligated to do something
			- From the *legal* POV, you're obligated to do something -- way of being agnostic towards claims of the law
			- Legal POV is a moral theory according to which the shared plan of legal system allocates rights and responsibilities correctly
				- This POV says the shared plan is the morally right plan
			- Social facts that generate shared plan also generate a normative perspective that sees shared plan as morally appropriate
			- So can generate moral obligations if using the word "legal" perspectivally

## Why I'm not an inclusive legal positivist, part II

- A plan cuts off deliberation about what you're supposed to do under certain circumstances
	- Don't balance reasons; point of the plan is to answer the question for you
- Simple logic of planning: the existence and content of a plan can't be determined by facts whose existence the plan aims to settle
	- If you have to deliberate in order to discover the plan, then you don't have a plan
	- Inclusive legal positivism violates this: if the point of having law is to settle matters about what morality requires so people can realize certain goals and values, then legal norms would be useless if the way to discover them is to engage in moral reasoning
	- Legal norms without institutional content are like can openers that only work when the can is already open
	- Requires you to know what the law is supposed to answer in order to know what the law is
	- Exclusive legal positivism doesn't violate this: no danger that the process of legal discovery will violate the purpose of having the law
		- Social facts are determined by empirical observation, not moral deliberation
		- Enables law to play plan-like function of answering questions about what we ought to do
	- But ELP doesn't rule out possibility that legal norms have social foundations that can have moral concepts
		- "Unconscionable contracts" is a moral concept; says it is grossly unfair to hold people to terms of this contract
		- No problem with exclusive legal positivist accepting this. Doesn't tell us *when* contract is unconscionable but says that unconscionable contracts should not be enforced
		- Judges not engaged in unrestricted moral delibation: judges ask whether contract is unconscionable, law still serves as plan because it takes some moral issues off the table
		- Deliberation is *channeled* in a certain direction
	- ELP rejects idea that a norm without institutional pedigree can still be a law
		- E.g.: Contracts that charge 20% interest rate are unconscionable
		- But no legal institution has decided that 20% is usurious and therefore unsconscionable
		- ILP: since 20% is unconscionable, any contract that charges 20% is legally unenforceable
		- ELP says the fact that no legal institution has picked that interest rate as being unconscionable means that it cannot be illegal
		- Once an institution has decided 20% is unconscionable, then it's the law that 20% contracts are legally unforceable

## Logic of planning

- If you think laws are plans, you must reject Dworkin's theory
- General logic of planning: when are circumstances complex and contentious, alternative forms of social planning increase costs of deliberation to the point that we never get anything solved
	- So we need a sophisticated institutional form of social planning: the law
- Dworkin's constructive interpretation is about discovering content of law by engaging in moral deliberation
	- Figuring out grounds of law requires figuring out what would make legal practice the best it can be -- what fits and justifies legal practice
	- If we're thinking about moral fit and justification, this is introducing the considerations the law is supposed to take off the table
	- Interpretation of any member of system of plans cannot be determined by facts any member of that system aims to settle
		- Recall the simple logic of planning: existence and content of plan can't be determined by facts that plan aims to answer
		- This takes it further: interpretation of any member can't be determined by *other* member of the system either
- Dworkin really violates this, even more than ILP does
	- ILP permits moral considerations to determine existence and content of legal norms even though legal norms aim to settle these moral considerations
	- Dworkin *unsettles* questions that have been settled -- have to delve into moral philosophy to answer questions about legal practice, renders previous decisions by legal institutions on these issues moot
		- Puts issues back on the table, frustrates ability to guide conduct in complex circumstances
