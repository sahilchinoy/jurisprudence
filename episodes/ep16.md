# Meta-interpretation

## Interpretive methodologies

- What is legal interpretation? The process of telling you what the law is
- The method you use is an *interpretive methodology*: a function that takes legal texts and produces the law
	- Originalism, textualism, living constitutionalism, intentionalism, etc.
- It could be that there's one interpretive methodology valid for every legal system
	- But we will assume that every legal system has its own interpretive methodology -- might need to distinguish federal system, state, etc.
- Interpretive methodology doesn't just take text into account. Ex: originalism, take into account original understanding
	- Other events, mental states of those who framed the provisions are important
- So, interpretive methodology is more precisely a function that takes legal texts, mental states, events, social practices as arguments and delivers legal norms
- Legal interpretations/methodology either give you the law or *extend* the law
	- Ex: prohibition against cruel punishment. Say the death penalty is cruel, but no court has ruled this
		- ELP: law doesn't prohibit death penalty until court says so
		- Moral fact that death penalty is cruel, so court should extend law to have it cover the death penalty
		- So when you decide death penalty is cruel, you're extending the law in applying moral reasoning
	- When a court has to decide that the death penalty is cruel and therefore prohibited, the court is interpreting the law
		- ELP considers this *extending* the law
		- So we don't want to say interpretation is just finding the law (like Ronald Dworkin would say)
- Meta-interpretive theory: not a methodology for interpreting legal texts, but a methodology for figuring out which interpretive methodology is proper
	- Dworkin's constructive interpretation is a theory of meta-interpretation -- interpretive methodology is the right one when it places legal principles in their best light, which is law as integrity
		- First stage of legal interpretation is meta-interpretation: Dworkin thinks you do constructive interpretation here
		- Second stage is applying the interpretive methodology, and for Dworkin, meta-interpretation gives you law as integrity, so at stage 2, you apply law as integrity to figure out what the law is
	- Dworkin doesn't really distinguish between the 2 stages

## The standard picture

- Standard picture of legal interpretation: legal content is linguistic content, so if you want to know what the law is, figure out what the legal texts mean
	- Hart: If you want to understand legal texts, explain what it means in natural language
	- You get the standard picture when people talk about judges: "judges should stick to the text," and if they don't, they will be creating law and that's not their role
		- If they don't, imposing their own moral and political views on the law
	- Hart: open texture and vagueness of natural language means law has indeterminacy
		- Get judicial creativity because judges have to make new law to plug the holes left open by language
	- Standard picture needs to argue why they're choosing the meaning they choose, but they often don't
	- Bad at dealing with case law: contribution a case makes to the law is just what it says? Often what a court *does* is more important than what it says
- Two kinds of meta-interpretive theories: one says look at social facts (maybe linguistic meaning, maybe what a court did), or look at moral facts too (more of a natural law approach to meta-interpretation)
	- Dworkin's theory of constructive interpretation (at least stage one) is well-developed natural law theory: thinks right interpretive theory is the one that puts legal practice in its morally best light
	- We have yet to see a meta-interpretive theory from a positivist
- Dworkin thinks the reason theoretical disagreements are common is that meta-interpretation involves moral reasoning, which is highly contested

## Economy of trust

- Hart says the right interpretation is given by rule of recognition
- Suggest another positivistic theory based on planning theory. Right meta-interpretive theory depends on identity of law, and according to planning theory, law is a planning system
	- So the right way to interpret the law is the right way to interpret plans
- We know how to interpret plans. One idea is to interpret plans according to their purpose
		- Flawed because plans are adopted not just to achieve a certain purpose, but also because they are trying to deal with certain constraints that make decisions on the spot difficult
		- Ex: lack of trust
		- More distrustful the plan is in the subject of the plan, the less discretion they should have in interpreting the text
- Expand to the law: think of legal systems as distributions of trust and distrust
	- If we are more distrustful in legal officials, we leave them less discretion to interpret the law in accordance with its purpose
	- Call this the "economy of trust"
	- Goal of meta-interpretation is to find interpretive methodology that best harmonizes with that system's economy of trust
	- Textualists and orginalists say judges shouldn't have a lot of discretion because the American legal system is highly distrustful
- Trust is not the only thing that matters in planning. Also level of conflict of interest between the planners and the planned
	- When we disagree with one another, if we plan, we can still coordinate
	- More pluralism means there's less discretion judges should have, since plans were generated precisely because there was disagreement about deeper issues, and you don't want interpreters to go to deeper issues in cases of doubt, because then you're undoing what the plan was meant to solve
- Meta-interpreter should figure out the economy of trust of a legal system and level of pluralism, and accord enough discretion to interpreters that is appropriate
- Disagreement about interpretive methodology can be reconstructed as disagreements about level of trust and the level of conflict of values
- These are social facts, so this is a positivistic theory
