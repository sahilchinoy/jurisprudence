# Why I am not an inclusive legal positivist, part I

## Raz on authority

- Possible content of rule of recognition
	- Inclusive legal positivism: criteria of legal validity can be anything, as long as legal officials accept them
	- Exclusive legal positivism: law has certain constraints, so a norm is not a legal norm just because it's morally appropriate -- need some institutional source
- Most positivists are inclusive legal positivists
	- Seems like it's descriptively superior: constitutional provisions of many legal systems formulated in moral terms (e.g. "cruel and unusual punishment", "human dignity shall be inviolable")
	- Easiest way to respond to Dworkin: judges look to principles in hard cases because rule of recognition requires them to do so
- Joseph Raz's argument against inclusive legal positivism
	- A necessary feature of all legal systems is that they claim justified practical authority over a population
		- Claim moral authority to impose obligations on citizens to obey its directives
	- If that claim is to be intelligible, legal system must be capable of exercising authority
	- When does the law have legitimate authority?
		- When legal officials are believed in their claim to authority by some part of the population -- they are *de facto* authorities
	- Service conception of authority: legal systems have legitimate authority when they provide a service
	- Each of us constantly faced with the question "what should I do?"
	- We balance the "first-order reasons for action" and choose the best-supported action
	- Sometimes rationality suggests that we should not attempt to engage in balancing of first-order reasons; sometimes we should ignore the reasons we have
		- Why? If doing so would enable us to act on balance of first-order reasons better than if we complied with them directly
		- Second-order reasons to exclude first-order reasons
			- E.g. you make a plan in advance because you know in the moment you'll mess up the balancing of first-order reasons
	- Raz says legitimate authorities provide us with second-order, exclusionary reasons
	- Normal justification thesis: normally, authorities give us directives so that, by following them, we better conform to reasons we have independent of those directives than if we tried to conform to those reasons directly

## The argument from authority

- When is it possible to have legitimate authority? When directives are second-order exclusionary reasons that help you fulfill first-order reasons. 2 cases:
	1. Coordination: by following directives of authority, can contribute to realization of public goods
	2. Expertise: authorities know how the first-order reasons apply to us better than we do (public health, national security, environmental protection)
- Necessary that interpretation of authoritative directives can't depend on first-order reasons they are intended to exclude and replace
	- But this is what inclusive legal positivism allows subjects of authority to do
	- Inclusive legal positivism says criteria of legal validity could be moral fairness of a norm
	- But the whole point of a legal directive is to replace those reasons and exclude them from your deliberation
		- Fairness is a first-order reason for action -- law is supposed to consider these and issue a directive that excludes and replaces that first-order reason
		- But the inclusive legal positivist says you can consider those first-order reasons when you decide whether that directive is authoritative
		- That undoes the very idea of having the authoritative directive
	- If in order to know what directive is you have to answer the question the authority is claiming to answer, the purpose of having legitimate authority evaporates
- 2 problems with this:
	1. Links two things a positivist wouldn't have linked: conceptual question of what law is with the moral question of when it's legitimate
		- Conceptual: all law claims legitimate authority
		- Moral: theory of when law generates moral obligation to obey
		- Linking the two: in order to know what the law is conceptually, you have to know when it's justified
			- Weird for positivist to say that what the law is depends on the political philosophy of when it's justified
			- Sounds much more like Dworkin
	2. To claim legitimate authority, you must have it
		- Makes anarchism an incoherent theory because anarchism says law claims authority but doesn't have it

## The practical difference thesis

- Inclusive legal positivism: certain legal rules can't guide conduct, only *pedigreed* rules can
- Positivists think function of law is to guide conduct
	- Norms cannot guide conduct
	- Law must make a practical difference to our reasoning
- In order for a rule to guide conduct, it has to motivate you to act in a way differently than if you hadn't appealed to the law
- Can't say law is guiding conduct if appealing to it never makes a difference in how you act or how you're motivated to act
- Moral principles that lack institutional sources can't make practical differences
- If inclusive rule of recognition makes a practical difference, the moral principle validated by it can't make a difference
	- Rule of recognition tells judge to follow morality, so regardless of whether they follow the actual moral principle, they do the same thing
- Argument doesn't work for exclusive rule of recognition
	- Law passed does make a difference: if law is repealed, judge might act differently
	- Doesn't work for moral principles because these can't be repealed
