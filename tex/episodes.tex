  Is legal philosophy an attempt to understand the meaning of the term
  ``law''?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is the semantic theory of law
  \item
    Not an interesting question. Why?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Law is an English word -- why should we care about a particular
      English word?
    \item
      Capacious word: applies to things we don't consider to be ``law''
      in the sense of legal rules

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Think scientific laws, mathematics, grammar
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Instead, we want to know the nature of the thing that the word ``law''
  refers to: nature of legal institutions, rules, rights

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Not a \emph{semantic} question, but a \emph{metaphysical} one
  \item
    Consider the question ``what is the nature of something?'' Two
    approaches:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Could be interested in the identity -- the essential properties of
      an object
    \item
      Could be interested in the necessary properties
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Take the number three

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Identity: number that comes after two
    \item
      Necessary properties: odd, divisor of nine

      \begin{itemize}

      \item
        But these don't characterize its identity

    more than 65 miles per hour

  \begin{itemize}

  What do legal facts depend on? Two possibilities:

  \begin{enumerate}

    Social facts alone. People got together and decided something
  \item
    Also moral facts

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Why is it against the law to drive more than 65 m.p.h.? Not simply
      that legislature and governor decided -- it's that people in CA
      \emph{ought} to listen to what they say

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Perhaps because they are democratically elected
      \end{itemize}

  \tightlist
  \item
    Whichever is true, this is a necessary property of law

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Matters because if the first is true, then legal reasoning does
      not involve moral reasoning

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Just need to figure out which social facts ground law

    Ex: Congress enacts stimulus plan

    Why is that legally valid? Article I of the Constitution
  \item
    Why is Article I legally valid? The Constitution has been ratified,

    then it's valid
  \item

    Deny the egg principle: certain bodies have authority even if there

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Austin does this: law is possible because there is an ultimate
      authority (the sovereign) who gets authority from pure political
      power
    \item

    \item

  If you don't believe in moral facts, do you have to be a legal

\item
  Law has two parts: theory of rules and theory of sovereignty. Law =

\item
  All rules are commands: expression of a wish, backed by a threat to
  inflict an evil if the wish is not fulfilled, issued by someone who is
  willing and able to act on the threat

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Austin thought obligations were analytically related to commands in
    that people are under obligation when another expresses a wish,
    backed by threat, that they act or don't act a certain way

    Anytime someone commands someone to do something, they're obligated
    to do it

    Whether you habitually obey someone is not a normative statement,

    A rule is a general command

    \begin{itemize}

      A command is the expression of wish issued by someone willing and

    A legal system exists when there is a sovereign who issues general

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hart critiques Austin's theory of rules

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For Austin, all laws are ``duty-imposing''

    \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Lots of legal rules are: duty not to kill other people, reasonable
      care, etc.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    But there are other rules that ``confer power''

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Constitutional law: set of laws that confer power
    \item
      Civil procedure: confer power on private citizens to bring suit,
      property rights
    \item
      We talk about these rules very differently
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If you don't conform to a rule that imposes duty, you have
    ``violated'' it. You're ``guilty''

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      But we don't say that about power-conferring rules
    \item
      If you don't get two witnesses for a will, you're not ``guilty''
      -- you just didn't do what the law tells you to do if you want to
      have certain kinds of legal effects

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        No punishments or sanctions, but your actions are null and void:
        they have no legal effect
      \end{itemize}

    No sanctions associated with power-conferring rules?
  \item
    Austin's response: actually, power-conferring rules \emph{are}
    general commands backed by threat of sanction: nullity
  \item
    If you don't follow the rules, you are ``sanctioned'' in the sense
    that what you wanted to do won't be done

\item
  Hart: but there is a difference between duty-imposing and
  power-conferring rules in their relationship to sanctions

  \begin{itemize}

    Power-conferring rules are not real rules; they are fragments of

  Austin expanded category of sanctions to include nullities

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Kelsen says no, sanctions are what Hart thinks they are, but
    power-conferring rules are not rules in their own right
  \end{itemize}
\item
  All rules have sanctions built-in

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All rules are directed at legal officials, not ordinary citizens
  \item
    Direct them to impose sanctions under certain circumstances
  \item
    Ex: a testator has authority to distribute estate according to
    wishes if and only if they sign the will and two witnesses attest

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Kelsen: that's only part of the rule. The rule is a long
      conditional where the antecedent is what the testator has to do,
      and the consequent is what duties the court is under regarding the
      executor carrying out the will
    \item
      Rule which seems to confer power on testator is really the
      conditions under which court is under duty to impose sanction on
      executor if they don't execute the will
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hart's response to Kelsen: this distorts the function of the law

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Function of the law is to guide our conduct: guides testator
    conduct, guides executor's conduct, guides probate court's
    conduct\ldots{}
  \item
    Then it's silly to think all rules are directed at officials to
    impose sanctions on executors
  \item
    It's backwards to say that the wills law is directed at officials.
    It's directed at the people who want to write wills, the people who
    have to execute them, etc.

\item
  Hart's critique: Austin says all laws are commands which impose
  duties, but this ignores power-conferring rules
\item
  Continue Hart's critique: even with respect to duty-imposing rules, is
  Austin's theory correct? Is it true that they really are general
  commands, backed by threats of sanctions?
\item
  People obey the law not just because they want to avoid sanctions, but
  because they think they're morally obligated to do so

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Austin could say: sure, but what makes it \emph{the law} is that it
    is backed by sanctions
  \item
    But when we say the good citizen responds to the law because ``it's
    the law,'' what we mean is not just that they think law has content
    that is morally good

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Consider the law against murder: the good citizen doesn't want to
      take life without justification and the fact that the law tells
      them not to murder doesn't add to their motivation
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    But there are laws that the good citizen responds to but not because
    their content is morally good, but simply because the law requires
    them

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Whether I should pay my taxes at a certain rate is morally
      suspect, but the fact that the law requires me to do it means I
      should do it
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Reason to obey the law is \emph{content-independent}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can Austin's theory make sense of this?
  \item
    No.~For Austin, duty-imposing nature of the law is the fact that
    it's threatening an evil. But the good citizen is not following the
    law because of the evil threatened against them, but because the law
    demands it of them, and they think they are morally obligated to do
    what the law demands of them
  \item
    Austin gets duty-imposing nature of the law wrong by emphasizing
    sanctions
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Are laws commands? Sometimes. Police officer can tell you to stop,
  judge tells you to approach the bench, etc.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But most laws not imposed by command (created imperatively)
  \item
    Kelsen: in order to command something, you have to know what you're
    commanding. But legislation is created by legislators who don't know
    what's happening -- no legislator knows what content of an entire
    bill is
  \item
    Plus, laws apply to legislators themselves. Doesn't make sense to
    command oneself
  \item
    So Austin is wrong that laws are commands since laws are created in
    an impersonal, reflexive way
  \item
    Imperative theory of law can't explain the existence of customary
    law. Stare decisis (look to precedent) is customary but binding.
    Business customs can be legally binding in contract law

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      But custom is not command
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Austin would say custom is not law until courts apply it. When they
    do so (and sovereign doesn't contradict them) then the sovereign has
    tacitly commanded people to act according to the custom

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      But courts aren't applying custom with the hope that sovereign
      will let them do it. They are doing so because it's custom, and
      custom is law

  Austin rejects the ``egg principle'': sovereignty depends on habits,

  \begin{itemize}

    Austin can't explain this, since a habit of obedience takes time to

  obey nobody else

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Idea of constitutionalism is hard to explain

    \tightlist
    \item
      In U.K., Austin thought king/queen in Parliament was sovereign
    \item
      In U.S., it's ``the people.'' How do the people obey themselves?

      hat. When they obey the law they wear their ``subject'' hat

  \tightlist
  \item
    Can take internal POV because you think it might advance your
    career, or because people will judge you if you don't
  \item
    Can accept a behavioral regularity as a standard for any reason, but
    when you've taken it as a standard, you've taken internal POV
  \item
    It's normative, but not a \emph{moral} statement
  \end{itemize}

  Social rule is a social practice: behavioral regularity accepted from
  internal POV

\item
  Austin's theory: ignores existence of power-conferring rules, can't
  explain true nature of duty-imposing rules, can't explain continuity
  of legal authority, etc.
\item
  Can't explain intelligibility of law: we speak about law as
  institution that confers rights and imposes duties

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can't render normative nature of law intelligible because the theory
    is based on the non-normative, purely descriptive concept of power
  \item
    Power does not give you enough conceptual apparatus to explain
    rights, duties
  \item
    Category mistake: just because sovereign can force you to do
    something doesn't mean you \emph{ought} to do it
  \item
    Need to have law that gives us reasons to act: internal point of
    view
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hart says we take law as a guide to conduct and a way to evaluate
  others' conduct

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Social rule is not just behavioral regularity, it's accepted from
    internal POV
  \end{itemize}
\item
  At foundation of law: social rules/practices taken as guides of
  conduct, reasons for action
\item
  Imagine pre-legal society. All rules are customary: share food in a
  certain way, choose mates in a certain way, all accepted from internal
  POV

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Problem of uncertainty: one part of group says act this way, other
    says different, no way to resolve this other than by counting heads
  \item
    Problem of stasis: no way to change the rules quickly, have to wait
    until people's behavior changes and accept it from internal POV

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      You want to be able to change behavior by changing rules. But if
      the rules are how people act, then the only way you can change
      rules is by changing behavior
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Problem of inefficiency: no mechanism, institution to resolve
    disputes
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Law is a solution to these three problems

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Uncertainty: rule of recognition is the rule that tells you which
    rules are binding
  \item
    Stasis: rule of change is the power-conferring rule that says who
    has ability to change the rules
  \item
    Inefficiency: rule of adjudication is the social rule that
    designates institution/person to decide whether rules have been
    obeyed

recognition}\label{properties-of-the-rule-of-recognition}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rule of recognition: identifies properties of rules that make it
  authoritative within group

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In US: if Congress enacts legislation and signed by President (or
    overridden), then it's law, and judges have duty to apply/adjudicate
    it
  \item
    Secondary rule: a rule about other rules
  \item
    Social rule: practiced by group, accepted by internal POV
  \item
    Practiced only by officials. The rule of recognition is addressed to
    officials, like judges

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Citizens do not accept the rule of recognition
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Ultimate rule: its existence does not depend on any other rule
  \item
    Supreme rule: if anything conflicts, rule of recognition wins
  \item
    Tells you order of precedence of laws (ex: federal vs.~state)
  \item
    Duty-imposing rule: imposes duty on officials to apply certain rules
    to cases that arise before them
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rule of change, adjudication are power-conferring
\item
  Constitution is not rule of recognition -- it's a collection of rules
  of change and adjudication
\item
  Resolve Austin's puzzles:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Continuity: Austin cannot explain continuity of legal authority
    because thinks all sovereignty is derived from habits

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Hart: rule of recognition says whatever Rex II says becomes law
      when Rex I dies
    \item
      Continuous practice of rule recognition in the background
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Persistence: Austin can't explain how rules made 100 years ago still
    bind, since the threat is no longer valid

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Hart: rule of recognition says that if rule bears certain
      properties, then it is still a rule
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Rule of recognition is a supreme rule, don't need idea of habitual
    obedience to a sovereign
  \item
    What makes a law a law? Validated by group's rule of recognition
  \item
    Can explain how rules apply to their makers

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Legal rules are standards validated by rule of recognition, and
      you can make a standard that applies to yourself
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Doesn't imply sovereign is above the law, because for Hart,
    sovereign is \emph{created} by the law

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Austin's solution: chicken came first, i.e.~all law rests on
  sovereign, who is habitually obeyed and obeys nobody else. No further
  rule that makes sovereign the sovereign
\item
  Hart says that doesn't work. We need an egg: secondary social rules
  like the rule of recognition: a duty-imposing rule that sets out the
  criteria of legal validity
\item
  Who made secondary rules? Hart says nobody deliberately made them,
  rather, they are just social practices

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rule of recognition is created by legal officials listening to
    certain rules with certain characteristics, criticizing others when
    they don't
  \item
    Social rules are social practices
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Can a pattern of behavior impose duties? Let's say some judge doesn't
  follow the Constitution. All judges defer to Constitution and have
  critical reflective attitude towards that practice. That's a
  descriptive fact about the world -- where is the normative fact, that
  the judge \emph{ought} to follow the Constitution? This is Hume's
  challenge

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How can you get the legal ``ought'' from the descriptive ``is'' of
    social practice?
  \item
    Hart opts for expressivism: there are no normative facts in the
    world

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      But we can take different attitudes towards descriptive facts -- a
      descriptive attitude or a normative attitude
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Suppose someone has coronavirus. You can say ``this person has an
    infection and if you get near them, you could catch the virus''
    (descriptive attitude)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Or you can take normative attitude: ``Stay away from that person''
    \item
      Not an additional fact -- it's a different attitude to the fact
      that they are contagious
    \item
      Social practice can be engaged with either descriptively or
      normatively

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        You can take external POV or you can take internal POV -- take
        the social practice as a ``to-be-followedness''
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Law: taking social practice of rule recognition as binding is
      deriving an ought from the general internal POV of approaching
      social practice from perspective of ``ought''-ness

      They wanted to say rules are just predictions about people would

    \item
      Hart thinks this is a mistake -- rules have internal aspect. But

    \end{itemize}

    Maybe he should have said rules are \emph{created} by social
    practices

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This doesn't work either
    \item
      Can have social practices without rules: don't take your laptop
      into the shower
    \item
      Some social practices give rise to rules. But we need to know what
      kinds of social practices give rise to social rules

      \begin{itemize}

      \item
        Does the rule of recognition fall into this category?
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Perhaps the kind of social practices that give rise to social rules
  are \emph{coordination conventions}, which are recurring solutions to
  coordination problems

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Practice/convention to drive on the right side leads to a social
    rule
  \item
    Everyone tips 20 percent leads to a social rule

    and gives rise to social rule

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This is incorrect
    \item
      You follow a coordination convention because other people do so.
      Do officials in US follow Constitution because other officials do
      so?
    \item
      It's not arbitrary, like driving on right side of the road --
      officials have allegiance/respect for Constitution

    Hart's solution is not right -- can engage in legal reasoning
    without taking internal POV
  \item
    Can have selfish reasons for internal POV. Defendant says to judge:
    the only reason you're saying I broke the law is that you want to
    pick up your paycheck. How can I be punished because you just want

  weight''
\item
  Speed limit is a rule, applies in all-or-nothing manner
\item
  Principles can conflict, unlike rules
\item
  Dworkin says positivists think law is just rules, not principles
\item
  Weak discretion: exercise judgement in order to carry out an order

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``Do this at your discretion'' means your decision is not subject to
    review, but you're under an obligation to do \emph{something}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Strong discretion: under no duty/obligation at all
\item
  Positivists say when rules run out, judges exercise strong discretion

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No more rules, thus judges not under any duty to apply rules, thus
    they choose whatever standards they want
  \item
    Dworkin thinks this is a bad description of legal practice. Judges
    don't follow 2-step procedure: (1) check if rules apply (2) if not,
    make new law

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      They always act \emph{as if} there is law to apply
    \item
      Because law consists of principles as well as rules

  In hard cases, rules run out but legal principles do not. Judges must
  weigh them against each other to figure out what to do

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Does Dworkin mischaracterize Hart?

  \begin{itemize}

    Hart would have accepted that in addition to all-or-nothing
    standards, there are legal principles
  \item
    Dworkin trying to explain why Hart insisted judges exercise strong
    discretion
  \item
    Hart thought the law often runs out, so judges often exercise
    discretion and act like legislators
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If you're a positivist, you have to insist the law runs out since it
  depends on social facts alone

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There is a limit to guiding people's conduct through social guidance
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Legal principles are legal because of their content, not because of
  their pedigree

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Dworkin says this conflicts with first thesis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In hard cases, judges look to principles

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Thus the law doesn't consist of just rules (no strong discretion)

  \item
    When court looks outside the law to morality, judge is not

  \item
    Exclusive legal positivism: moral rules can never be legal rules
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Another response is to deny Dworkin's characterization: inclusive
  legal positivism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rule of recognition says that when pedigreed standards run out,

  What is formalism? Committed to 4 theses:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Judges must always apply the law and can't override it
  \item
    Determinacy: for any question, law has an answer. There is always
    law to apply

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Thus, law can't just be a list of rules, or it would have to be
      infinite
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Conceptualism: In order to derive the law, one has to know a set of
    general principles from which it is possible to interpret concepts
    to derive the answer in a particular case

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      There are not an infinite number of rules, just a handful of
      general principles in any area of law
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Amorality of adjudication: judges are not supposed to engage in
    moral reasoning
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  People think legal positivism (law rest on social facts alone, not
  moral facts) implies formalism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If law doesn't depend on moral facts, there are no moral facts to
    use when judges are deciding cases, so positivists are necessarily
    formalists; therefore positivism is wrong
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hart says positivism is not committed to formalism
\item
  Why is formalism dumb? Judicial opinions are filled with moral
  arguments about ``what justice requires'' or ``virtuous behavior'' or
  ``obscenity''
\item
  Hart wants to argue positivism implies \emph{anti}-formalism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you think there's always law to apply and judges are always
    supposed to apply it and never use moral reasoning, then it follows
    that law doesn't depend on moral facts
  \item
    But that's because you've assumed formalism is true (formalism →
    positivism)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  There are 2 ways to guide conduct, both incomplete:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

    Precedent or authoritative example

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist

    In either case, there are gaps in guidance

    \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Precedent: how similar to precedent does it have to be? Narrowly,
      broadly?
    \item
      General rule: what do you mean by ``hat,'' ``church,'' etc.?
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Hart: General terms in natural language have ``open texture'' or
    vagueness

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      No way in natural language to get rid of this vagueness
    \item
      General terms have a ``core'' of settled examples and a
      ``penumbra,'' an area of vagueness
    \item
      Can't get around this by introducing more rules, since more
      natural language would have its own open texture
    \item
      What if you say ``when it's vague, decide in favor of defendant''?

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        But ``vagueness'' and ``open texture'' are themselves vague and
        open-textured, leading to higher-order vagueness
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``Limits of the social'' argument: insofar as positivism believes that
  law is a set of standards that are picked out socially, law is going
  to be necessarily indeterminate because it can't cover every
  conceivable case

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because either you pick out law through authoritative example or
    you're using general terms in natural language
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Positivism implies anti-formalism: judges are going to have to rely on
  moral judgement to decide cases because they're going to run out of
  law to apply
\item
  Judges may act like they're finding the law, but when they apply
  morality to decide cases, they're making new law
\item
  Legal realism: reaction to formalism. Judges take principles and use
  them to make decisions based on policy considerations

  Can't get from principles to a specific case without using normative
  reasoning, and it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise

  Mistake to point to open texture as proof that law is indeterminate

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Yes, law has area of open texture, but also has area of settled
    meaning, a core
  \item
    So you also can't be a thoroughgoing skeptic about secondary rules

  Can be skeptic about complicated cases: Supreme Court decisions, cases

\item
  Hart: people confuse finality with infallibility

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Decision can be final but wrong
  \item
    E.g. impeachment: what is a high crime or misdemeanor? Whatever the
    Senate says it is? No.~It is true that nobody can challenge the
    Senate's decision about conviction. The decision is final, but it
    could be wrong
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin challenges the idea that when judges are looking to moral
  principles, they are making law

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    He thinks they're still \emph{finding} law, it's just that law
    depends on moral facts as well as social facts
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When it comes to resolving questions regarding the rule of
  recognition, judges make a decision, and if others accept it, it is
  the law going forward, because a new extension of social practice will
  have been formed

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When it's accepted, it becomes part of the rule of recognition
  \item
    The fact of acceptance makes it correctly decided (retrospectively)

  Judges are supposed to think about the purpose of the law

  Because we think judges should approach legal interpretation by
  considering statute's purpose, it's a mistake to think law and

    The judge, in looking to purpose, is trying to figure out what you

  important

  \begin{itemize}

    For guidance via example/authoritative precedent, we don't know how

  For Hart, legal positivism means law and morality are not necessarily

  Law and justice have an important connection, seem to go together

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    Differences:

    \tightlist
    \item
      Moral rules are almost always important; legal rules can be
      trivial
    \item
      Morality immune to deliberate change: can't repeal morality
    \item
      Morality has an element of voluntariness: you can always say ``I
      couldn't help it''
    \item
      Moral rules are backed socially; law is backed by financial and
      physical sanctions (in addition to social pressure)

      This is again nomological but not metaphysical

    \item
      Social facts can't pick out comprehensive standards of guidance

  Dworkin says judges \emph{never} act as though the law is

    Rule of recognition says that when socially designated standards run

  Dworkin shows why the legal positivist response won't work using a new
  critique: ``the problem of theoretical disagreements''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Most powerful objection to positivism
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin distinguishes \emph{propositions of law:} statement of a legal
  fact in a particular jurisdiction, which can be true or false by
  virtue of the \emph{grounds of law}: the facts that render a
  proposition of law true

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ex: Propositions of law in California are true if a bill that
    expresses the proposition is approved by a majority of the
    legislature, signed by governor, etc.
  \item
    In Hart's terminology, grounds of law are part of the criteria of
    legal validity
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin says people can disagree about the grounds of law in 2 ways:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Empirical disagreement about whether grounds of law are satisfied in
    a given case
  \item
    Theoretical disagreement about what the grounds of law \emph{are} in
    a particular legal system
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Dworkin says according to positivism, all disagreements about
  propositions of law are really empirical, never theoretical

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But it is common for legal actors to have theoretical disagreements
    and positivism can't explain this
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin says positivists accept ``plain-fact'' view of the law:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Grounds of law are the facts that people agree render propositions
    in that jurisdiction true
  \item
    Grounds of law must refer to matters of historical fact/pedigree

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This is saying all positivists are exclusive legal positivists
    \item
      But most people are inclusive legal positivists
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin says there are disagreements about grounds of law: which facts
  you look to in order to determine whether a proposition is true or
  false

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Positivists can't explain this because for them because for them
    grounds of law are determined by consensus

  Counterargument: positivism is correct but legal actors are incoherent

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But this is not a small disagreement, this is a fundamental feature
    of law: it is determined by consensus among legal actors
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Another counterargument: legal actors argue for things they don't
  believe in, even if they involve conceptual mistakes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But it's not the fact of the theoretical disagreement itself that is
    insincere, it's that they're arguing for a specific position
  \end{itemize}

  Analogy to literary criticism: theoretical disagreements about what
  Shakespeare meant, not empirical disagreements about what he said

    At bottom, having a disagreement about what makes literature
    valuable and what kind of methodology would make it the most
    valuable it could be

    practice in order to make it the best possible example of the form
    or genre to which it is taken to belong''
  \item
    Ask ``what makes literature great?'' and then pick a methodology
    that reflects that
  \item
    In law: imposing moral theory about what makes law valuable, grounds
    of law are the ones that make law morally the best that it can be

    \begin{itemize}

  Fit: extent to which it approves of the object's existence or its
  properties

    One purpose fits better than another when it recommends behavior
    that more closely matches observed conduct

    Goodwill and peace on earth is more justified than rank

    The moral purpose of the practice
  \item
    The sets of facts such a purpose commends as the grounds of law

  \item
    Fits: facts it identifies are actually the grounds of law recognized

  \item
    Justifies: purpose it assigns to law is morally justifiable

  Conventionalism: rights and responsibilities flow from past political
  acts when they are specifically decided by those acts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To identify rights and responsibilities, look to the conventions of
    the system
  \item
    Purpose: to give people fair warning and protect their expectations
    about how the state is going to act
  \item
    Grounds: those given by convention
  \item
    If you respect convention, then you will be protecting people's

  \item
    Sounds like exclusive legal positivism, but it isn't

    \begin{itemize}

      and coherent manner towards all its citizens''

    If we treat some members of a community some way, even if we treated

\item
  Joseph Raz's argument against inclusive legal positivism

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A necessary feature of all legal systems is that they claim

    \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Claim moral authority to impose obligations on citizens to obey
      its directives

    exercising authority
  \item
    When does the law have legitimate authority?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      When legal officials are believed in their claim to authority by
      some part of the population -- they are \emph{de facto}

  \item
    Service conception of authority: legal systems have legitimate
    authority when they provide a service
  \item
    Each of us constantly faced with the question ``what should I do?''
  \item
    We balance the ``first-order reasons for action'' and choose the
    best-supported action
  \item
    Sometimes rationality suggests that we should not attempt to engage
    in balancing of first-order reasons; sometimes we should ignore the
    reasons we have

    \begin{itemize}

      Why? If doing so would enable us to act on balance of first-order
      reasons better than if we complied with them directly

  \item
    Raz says legitimate authorities provide us with second-order,
    exclusionary reasons
  \item
    Normal justification thesis: normally, authorities give us

  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Coordination: by following directives of authority, can contribute
    to realization of public goods
  \item
    Expertise: authorities know how the first-order reasons apply to us
    better than we do (public health, national security, environmental
    protection)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Necessary that interpretation of authoritative directives can't depend
  on first-order reasons they are intended to exclude and replace

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But this is what inclusive legal positivism allows subjects of
    authority to do
  \item
    Inclusive legal positivism says criteria of legal validity could be
    moral fairness of a norm
  \item
    But the whole point of a legal directive is to replace those reasons
    and exclude them from your deliberation

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Fairness is a first-order reason for action -- law is supposed to
      consider these and issue a directive that excludes and replaces
      that first-order reason
    \item
      But the inclusive legal positivist says you can consider those
      first-order reasons when you decide whether that directive is
      authoritative
    \item
      That undoes the very idea of having the authoritative directive
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If in order to know what directive is you have to answer the
    question the authority is claiming to answer, the purpose of having
    legitimate authority evaporates

  2 problems with this:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist

    question of what law is with the moral question of when it's
    legitimate

    \begin{itemize}

    \item
      Conceptual: all law claims legitimate authority
    \item
      Moral: theory of when law generates moral obligation to obey
    \item
      Linking the two: in order to know what the law is conceptually,
      you have to know when it's justified

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Weird for positivist to say that what the law is depends on the
        political philosophy of when it's justified
      \item
        Sounds much more like Dworkin
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    To claim legitimate authority, you must have it

    \begin{itemize}

    Rule of recognition tells judge to follow morality, so regardless of

    \item
      Legal systems unable to solve serious moral problems are

      Consider criminal organizations. They are institutional,
      compulsory, but they are not legal systems because we don't think

      moral problem of the circumstances of legality

      \begin{itemize}

    problems that can't be solved through other forms of social
    ordering. But not a legal system! Why not?
  \item
    Maybe: legal systems always claim \emph{supreme authority}, and
    Florida law trumps the condo rules

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This argument doesn't work because then Florida wouldn't have a

\item
  Although state law must comply with federal law, federal law
  automatically presumes state law complies with federal law

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Federal law gives states the benefit of the doubt, allows them to
    make and enforce law without first checking
  \item
    By contrast, states afford nothing comparable to private actors
  \item
    Not enough for rules made by private actors to be in compliance with
    state law. They are not allowed to enforce laws unless private actor
    demonstrates compliance with state laws
  \item
    State police can yank skinny dipper from pool. Condo board can't do
    that -- they need to call police, prosecutor needs to be involved

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Condo board doesn't enjoy same presumption of validity/compliance
      as state government
    \end{itemize}

\item
  Legal systems are \emph{self-certifying} systems

  \begin{itemize}

  \tightlist
  \item
    Planning theory follows ``egg'' principle: all authority comes from
    norms of instrumental rationality
  \item
    We are planning creatures, able to coordinate across time and
    people, and through this form of partial-staged deliberation we

    The foundation of legal system is a shared plan -- most officials
    accept their part in the plan
  \item
    Ability to adopt and share a plan is unmysterious

    \item
      Hart failed to specify what kinds of practices generate rules
    \end{itemize}

    If you have to deliberate in order to discover the plan, then you

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      ``Unconscionable contracts'' is a moral concept; says it is
      grossly unfair to hold people to terms of this contract
    \item
      No problem with exclusive legal positivist accepting this. Doesn't
      tell us \emph{when} contract is unconscionable but says that
      unconscionable contracts should not be enforced
    \item
      Judges not engaged in unrestricted moral delibation: judges ask
      whether contract is unconscionable, law still serves as plan
      because it takes some moral issues off the table
    \item
      Deliberation is \emph{channeled} in a certain direction
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    ELP rejects idea that a norm without institutional pedigree can
    still be a law

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      E.g.: Contracts that charge 20\% interest rate are unconscionable
    \item
      But no legal institution has decided that 20\% is usurious and
      therefore unsconscionable
    \item
      ILP: since 20\% is unconscionable, any contract that charges 20\%
      is legally unenforceable
    \item
      ELP says the fact that no legal institution has picked that
      interest rate as being unconscionable means that it cannot be
      illegal
    \item
      Once an institution has decided 20\% is unconscionable, then it's
      the law that 20\% contracts are legally unforceable
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Logic of planning}\label{logic-of-planning}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you think laws are plans, you must reject Dworkin's theory
\item
  General logic of planning: when are circumstances complex and
  contentious, alternative forms of social planning increase costs of
  deliberation to the point that we never get anything solved

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    So we need a sophisticated institutional form of social planning:
    the law
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin's constructive interpretation is about discovering content of
  law by engaging in moral deliberation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Figuring out grounds of law requires figuring out what would make
    legal practice the best it can be -- what fits and justifies legal
    practice
  \item
    If we're thinking about moral fit and justification, this is
    introducing the considerations the law is supposed to take off the
    table
  \item
    Interpretation of any member of system of plans cannot be determined
    by facts any member of that system aims to settle

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Recall the simple logic of planning: existence and content of plan
      can't be determined by facts that plan aims to answer
    \item
      This takes it further: interpretation of any member can't be
      determined by \emph{other} member of the system either
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin really violates this, even more than ILP does

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ILP permits moral considerations to determine existence and content
    of legal norms even though legal norms aim to settle these moral
    considerations
  \item
    Dworkin \emph{unsettles} questions that have been settled -- have to
    delve into moral philosophy to answer questions about legal
    practice, renders previous decisions by legal institutions on these
    issues moot

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Puts issues back on the table, frustrates ability to guide conduct
      in complex circumstances
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretive
methodologies}\label{interpretive-methodologies}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is legal interpretation? The process of telling you what the law
  is
\item
  The method you use is an \emph{interpretive methodology}: a function
  that takes legal texts and produces the law

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Originalism, textualism, living constitutionalism, intentionalism,
    etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It could be that there's one interpretive methodology valid for every
  legal system

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But we will assume that every legal system has its own interpretive
    methodology -- might need to distinguish federal system, state, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Interpretive methodology doesn't just take text into account. Ex:
  originalism, take into account original understanding

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Other events, mental states of those who framed the provisions are
    important
  \end{itemize}
\item
  So, interpretive methodology is more precisely a function that takes
  legal texts, mental states, events, social practices as arguments and
  delivers legal norms
\item
  Legal interpretations/methodology either give you the law or
  \emph{extend} the law

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ex: prohibition against cruel punishment. Say the death penalty is
    cruel, but no court has ruled this

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      ELP: law doesn't prohibit death penalty until court says so
    \item
      Moral fact that death penalty is cruel, so court should extend law
      to have it cover the death penalty
    \item
      So when you decide death penalty is cruel, you're extending the
      law in applying moral reasoning
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    When a court has to decide that the death penalty is cruel and
    therefore prohibited, the court is interpreting the law

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      ELP considers this \emph{extending} the law
    \item
      So we don't want to say interpretation is just finding the law
      (like Ronald Dworkin would say)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Meta-interpretive theory: not a methodology for interpreting legal
  texts, but a methodology for figuring out which interpretive
  methodology is proper

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Dworkin's constructive interpretation is a theory of
    meta-interpretation -- interpretive methodology is the right one
    when it places legal principles in their best light, which is law as
    integrity

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      First stage of legal interpretation is meta-interpretation:
      Dworkin thinks you do constructive interpretation here
    \item
      Second stage is applying the interpretive methodology, and for
      Dworkin, meta-interpretation gives you law as integrity, so at
      stage 2, you apply law as integrity to figure out what the law is
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Dworkin doesn't really distinguish between the 2 stages
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-standard-picture}{%
\subsection{The standard picture}\label{the-standard-picture}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Standard picture of legal interpretation: legal content is linguistic
  content, so if you want to know what the law is, figure out what the
  legal texts mean

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hart: If you want to understand legal texts, explain what it means
    in natural language
  \item
    You get the standard picture when people talk about judges: ``judges
    should stick to the text,'' and if they don't, they will be creating
    law and that's not their role

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If they don't, imposing their own moral and political views on the
      law
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Hart: open texture and vagueness of natural language means law has
    indeterminacy

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Get judicial creativity because judges have to make new law to
      plug the holes left open by language
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Standard picture needs to argue why they're choosing the meaning
    they choose, but they often don't
  \item
    Bad at dealing with case law: contribution a case makes to the law
    is just what it says? Often what a court \emph{does} is more
    important than what it says
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Two kinds of meta-interpretive theories: one says look at social facts
  (maybe linguistic meaning, maybe what a court did), or look at moral
  facts too (more of a natural law approach to meta-interpretation)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Dworkin's theory of constructive interpretation (at least stage one)
    is well-developed natural law theory: thinks right interpretive
    theory is the one that puts legal practice in its morally best light
  \item
    We have yet to see a meta-interpretive theory from a positivist
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dworkin thinks the reason theoretical disagreements are common is that
  meta-interpretation involves moral reasoning, which is highly
  contested
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{economy-of-trust}{%
\subsection{Economy of trust}\label{economy-of-trust}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hart says the right interpretation is given by rule of recognition
\item
  Suggest another positivistic theory based on planning theory. Right
  meta-interpretive theory depends on identity of law, and according to
  planning theory, law is a planning system

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    So the right way to interpret the law is the right way to interpret
    plans
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We know how to interpret plans. One idea is to interpret plans
  according to their purpose - Flawed because plans are adopted not just
  to achieve a certain purpose, but also because they are trying to deal
  with certain constraints that make decisions on the spot difficult -
  Ex: lack of trust - More distrustful the plan is in the subject of the
  plan, the less discretion they should have in interpreting the text
\item
  Expand to the law: think of legal systems as distributions of trust
  and distrust

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If we are more distrustful in legal officials, we leave them less
    discretion to interpret the law in accordance with its purpose
  \item
    Call this the ``economy of trust''
  \item
    Goal of meta-interpretation is to find interpretive methodology that
    best harmonizes with that system's economy of trust
  \item
    Textualists and orginalists say judges shouldn't have a lot of
    discretion because the American legal system is highly distrustful
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Trust is not the only thing that matters in planning. Also level of
  conflict of interest between the planners and the planned

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When we disagree with one another, if we plan, we can still
    coordinate
  \item
    More pluralism means there's less discretion judges should have,
    since plans were generated precisely because there was disagreement
    about deeper issues, and you don't want interpreters to go to deeper
    issues in cases of doubt, because then you're undoing what the plan
    was meant to solve
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Meta-interpreter should figure out the economy of trust of a legal
  system and level of pluralism, and accord enough discretion to
  interpreters that is appropriate
\item
  Disagreement about interpretive methodology can be reconstructed as
  disagreements about level of trust and the level of conflict of values
\item
  These are social facts, so this is a positivistic theory
\end{itemize}
